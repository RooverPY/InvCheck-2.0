FAQ - 

"Ratelimited" means DIscord has blocked your IP and you can temporarily no longer access their invite service with it. To bypass this simply use a reliable proxy server with the format ip:port 
"Ratelimit" hanging even with proxy means the proxy you are using is slow or blacklisted. This is common for free proxies. If you want me to make a scraper to help make this easier for free users, lmk.
"Invalid invite" means the server invite generated isn't real. Realistically you have a .0001% chance at generating a valid invite.
